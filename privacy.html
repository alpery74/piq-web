                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>PIQ Labs (“PIQ,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our website, use the PIQ mobile application, or engage with any PIQ services (collectively, the “Services”). We follow a data-minimization approach and only collect the small set of details described in Section 2.</p>
                <p>By accessing or using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use the Services.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="legal-section animate-on-scroll">
                <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>We intentionally limit the information we collect to the minimum required to operate PIQ. Unless you voluntarily provide additional context (for example in a support request), we only collect the following data points:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>User Identifiers:</strong> Your name, PIQ user ID, and contact email address so we can authenticate your account and deliver service updates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Contact Number (Optional):</strong> A phone number if you choose to share it for account recovery or support purposes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Failure Diagnostics:</strong> Non-identifying error logs and crash diagnostics that help us monitor system reliability and improve code quality. These logs may include timestamps and device metadata but do not contain portfolio holdings or trading activity.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect or store brokerage credentials, trade execution data, or any other personal information beyond what is listed above.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="legal-section animate-on-scroll">
                <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <p>We process the limited information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Verifying your identity, securing your account, and communicating about product updates or service changes.</li>
                    <li>Providing customer support and responding to inquiries sent from your registered email address or phone number.</li>
                    <li>Monitoring reliability, troubleshooting errors, and improving code quality using anonymized failure diagnostics.</li>
                    <li>Complying with applicable laws, enforcing our Terms of Use, and protecting the integrity of the Services.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or make your personal contact details available to advertisers or other third parties. Third-party vendors acting on our behalf access only what is necessary to deliver their contracted service and are bound by confidentiality obligations.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="legal-section animate-on-scroll">
                <h2>4. How We Share Information</h2>

                    <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> When required to comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, or enforceable government requests.</li>
                    <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In connection with a merger, acquisition, financing, or sale of assets, provided the receiving party agrees to safeguard your information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aggregated Insights:</strong> We may publish or share anonymized reliability trends derived from diagnostic data, but these insights never identify a user.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="legal-section animate-on-scroll">
                <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
                <p>We implement technical and organizational safeguards designed to protect your information, including encryption in transit and at rest, access controls, monitoring, and regular security reviews. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

            <section class="legal-section animate-on-scroll">
                <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
                <p>We retain Personal Information for as long as necessary to provide the Services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. When information is no longer required, we will delete or anonymize it in accordance with our retention policies.</p>
